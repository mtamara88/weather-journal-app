## Overview
This project is about working with Web APIs and asynchronous code, creating a web app that uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API to get weather based on user's location, and dynamically update UI. The user can input their zip code (US only) and enter their feelings, which will generate a journal entry. This entry includes the current date, temperature at the location they entered and the text the user wrote.
